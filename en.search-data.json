Can I use it to screen mirror Netflix/Prime Video/HBO Max/etc? No. Streaming services like Netflix/Prime Video/HBO MaxNetflix/Prime Video/HBO Max/Disney+/Paramount+ and others use DRM to protect their content from copying. Unfortunately, DRM prevents us from being able to screen share this content. Can I control my iPhone from my iPad? No, you can‚Äôt. Instead, I use a Bluetooth remote to start/stop recording and shutter control. I got it with my tripod for free, so they should be pretty affordable. Can I use it on the field/outside? Or when traveling and not connected to Wi-Fi Yes, you can. Just enable Personal Hotspot and connect another device to it. Alternatively, you can wire devices with a USB-C cable. However, not all iPhone/iPad models support this, even if they are USB-C-capable. What if I have a problem or want a feature? Contact me, ideally via Discord.
